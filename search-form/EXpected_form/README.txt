I set the select to 50px to make the form look like a block
 and did this too but this is bad a good place to start maybe to add new class to set max-height, and max-width then set 50px so that it dose not affect other mostly in admin area and registration too.

select#slct2 {
  max-width: 214px;
}

input#submit-id-submit {
  height: 50px;
}
